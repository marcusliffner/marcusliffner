Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I tought that the 10 and 100 would have a bigger difrence. So i would say the secound one (100)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: On the fith simulation it gets pritty clear.
